#NodeJS and Yun

Example code for running a NodeJS on the Arduino Yun. See [andysigler.com/nodejs_yun](andysigler.com/nodejs_yun) for how to install NodeJS on the Yun, and set the board up to be used with Bridge.

When running, place only app.js and index.html on the Yun. All other files are not needed, since node-modules are installed globally on the Yun.
